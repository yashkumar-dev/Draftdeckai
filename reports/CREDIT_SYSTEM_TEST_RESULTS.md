## Manual Testing Guide

To thoroughly test the credit deduction functionality in a live environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. Have a test user account with sufficient credits (at least 20)
2. Access to the Supabase database to verify credit changes
3. API client (Postman, curl, or browser dev tools) for testing

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Diagram Generation
**Steps:**
1. Note current credit balance
2. Generate a diagram via `/api/generate/diagram`
3. Verify credits decreased by 1
4. Check `credit_usage_log` table for entry

- Status: 200 OK
- Credits used: 1
- Database shows credit deduction
- Usage log entry created

#### Test Case 2: Letter Generation
**Steps:**
1. Note current credit balance
2. Generate a letter via `/api/generate/letter`
3. Verify credits decreased by 1
4. Check `credit_usage_log` table for entry

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Credits used: 1
- Database shows credit deduction
- Usage log entry created

#### Test Case 3: ATS Analysis
**Steps:**
1. Note current credit balance
2. Analyze resume via `/api/analyze-ats`
3. Verify credits decreased by 1
4. Check `credit_usage_log` table for entry

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Credits used: 1
- Database shows credit deduction
- Usage log entry created

#### Test Case 4: Resume ATS Score
**Steps:**
1. Note current credit balance
2. Calculate ATS score via `/api/resume/ats-score`
3. Verify credits decreased by 1
4. Check `credit_usage_log` table for entry

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Credits used: 1
- Database shows credit deduction
- Usage log entry created

#### Test Case 5: Presentation Generation (Multiple Slides)
**Steps:**
1. Note current credit balance
2. Generate 5-slide presentation via `/api/generate/presentation`
3. Verify credits decreased by 5
4. Check `credit_usage_log` table for entry

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Credits used: 5 (1 per slide)
- Database shows credit deduction
- Usage log entry created with slide count

#### Test Case 6: Insufficient Credits
**Steps:**
1. Set user credits to 0 or less than required
2. Attempt to generate any content
3. Verify error response

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 402 Payment Required
- Error message: "Not enough credits"
- No credit deduction
- No content generated

#### Test Case 7: Unauthenticated Request
**Steps:**
1. Make request without Bearer token
2. Verify error response

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 401 Unauthorized
- Error message: "Authentication required"
- No credit deduction

#### Test Case 8: Invalid Bearer Token
**Steps:**
1. Make request with invalid/expired token
2. Verify error response

**Expected Result:**
- Status: 401 Unauthorized
- Error message: "Authentication required"
- No credit deduction

## Credit Reset Logic

### ✅ Monthly Calendar Reset (1st of Each Month)

Credits reset on the **1st day of each calendar month** at 00:00:00 UTC, ensuring users get their full monthly credit allowance consistently.

**How It Works:**
1. When a user first uses the service (or when credits are created), `credits_reset_at` is set to the 1st day of the next month
2. Before each generation request, the system checks if the current date has passed the reset date
3. If yes, `credits_used` is reset to 0 and `credits_reset_at` is updated to the 1st of the next month
4. This ensures credits reset monthly on the 1st, giving users their full monthly allowance

**Example Timeline:**
- **Jan 5**: User signs up, gets 20 credits, reset_at = Feb 1
- **Jan 20**: User has 10 credits left
- **Feb 1**: Credits automatically reset to 20, reset_at = Mar 1
- **Feb 15**: User has 15 credits left
- **Mar 1**: Credits automatically reset to 20, reset_at = Apr 1

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Reset date correctly calculated as 1st of next month at 00:00 UTC
- ✅ Verified across different dates (mid-month, end-of-month, year transitions)
- ✅ Free tier: 20 credits per month (confirmed)
- ✅ Past reset dates correctly trigger credit reset
- ✅ Future reset dates correctly prevent premature reset

## Database Verification Queries

### Check User Credits
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_credits WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';
```

### Check Usage Log
```sql
SELECT * FROM credit_usage_log
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Credit Deduction
```sql
SELECT
  uc.user_id,
  uc.credits_total,
  uc.credits_used,
  (uc.credits_total - uc.credits_used) as credits_remaining,
  COUNT(cul.id) as total_actions,
  SUM(cul.credits_used) as total_credits_logged
FROM user_credits uc
LEFT JOIN credit_usage_log cul ON uc.user_id = cul.user_id
WHERE uc.user_id = '<user_id>'
GROUP BY uc.user_id, uc.credits_total, uc.credits_used;
```

## Security Verification

### ✅ Verified Security Measures
1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid Bearer token
2. **No Hardcoded Keys**: Removed hardcoded API key fallback
3. **API Key Validation**: Checks API key availability before processing
4. **SQL Injection**: Uses parameterized queries via Supabase
5. **Race Conditions**: Refetches credits before deduction in presentation route

### ✅ CodeQL Security Scan
- Status: **PASSED**
- Vulnerabilities Found: **0**
- Date: 2026-01-06

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Operations per Request
1. **Authentication**: 1 query (getUser)
2. **Credit Check**: 1-2 queries (select, possible insert/update for reset)
3. **Content Generation**: Variable (external API calls)
4. **Credit Deduction**: 2 queries (select for refetch, update)
5. **Usage Logging**: 1 query (insert)

**Total**: ~5-7 database operations per generation request

### Optimization Opportunities
- Credits are fetched twice (initial check + refetch) to prevent race conditions
- Consider using database transactions for atomic operations
- Cache credit data for short periods (with caution)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Content Generated but Logging Failed**: If credit deduction fails after content generation, user receives content with warning message. This is intentional to prioritize user experience.

2. **No Rollback on Failure**: If an error occurs after credit deduction but before content generation completes, credits are not automatically rolled back. Manual intervention may be required.

3. **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple simultaneous requests from same user may cause race conditions despite refetch logic. Consider implementing request locking for heavy concurrent usage.

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All automated tests PASSED**
✅ **All 5 endpoints properly implement credit system**
✅ **Security scan shows 0 vulnerabilities**
✅ **ESLint shows 0 warnings/errors**

The credit deduction system is **READY FOR PRODUCTION** pending manual testing validation.
