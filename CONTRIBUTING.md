## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Ready to contribute? Here's the fastest way to get started:

### 1️⃣ **Fork & Clone**

# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
1.Fork the repository using the **Fork** button (top right of the GitHub page).
2.Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DraftDeckAI.git
```
📝 Note: Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

### 🌿 Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch. This keeps your work separate from the `main` branch and helps maintain a clean commit history.

Run the following command:

```bash
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
📝 Replace your-branch-name with something meaningful, like improve-contributing-md or fix-typo-doc.

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ **Set Up Environment**

DraftDeckAI requires several API keys for full functionality.

## 🕒 Automated Dependency Updates

DraftDeckAI leverages automated tools to keep its dependencies up-to-date, ensuring security, performance, and compatibility. This process is managed through **Dependabot** and **GitHub Actions**, providing a seamless workflow for maintaining the project’s ecosystem.

### 🛠️ Setup and Configuration

#### ✅ Dependabot Configuration
A `.github/dependabot.yml` file is included to enable and configure automatic dependency updates for **npm** and other package managers. This file:
- Schedules **weekly checks**
- Manages updates for **minor and patch versions**
- Ignores **major updates** for critical packages (e.g., `next`, `react`) to prevent breaking changes

#### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/dependency_check.yml` workflow:
- Runs **dependency audits**, **security checks**, and **build tests**
- Triggers on a **weekly schedule** and for `push`/`pull_request` events on the `main` branch
- Includes a `dependabot-auto-merge` job to **automatically approve and merge** Dependabot PRs after successful validation

### 🚀 How to Use

#### 1. Enable Dependabot
The configuration is pre-set in the repository. Ensure the `.github/dependabot.yml` file is present and committed to your fork or branch.

#### 2. Test the Workflow
Run the `test-dependabot-config` workflow manually via GitHub Actions with the `create_test_pr` input set to `true` on a test branch (e.g., `test-bot`) to verify the update process. This simulates dependency updates and triggers CI checks.

#### 3. Monitor PRs
Dependabot will automatically create pull requests for outdated dependencies. Review these PRs — the CI workflow will validate them. **Approved PRs are automatically merged** if all checks pass.

#### 4. Validate Updates
The workflow includes **tests and builds** to ensure updated dependencies do not break functionality. This helps maintain a **stable and secure** application. Check the **GitHub Actions logs** for detailed output.

## 🌿 Git Workflow & Best Practices

We use a simple but effective Git workflow that keeps our codebase clean and organized.

### 🌳 **Branch Naming Convention**

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/your-feature-name
feature/ai-prompt-optimization

# Bug fix branches
fix/issue-description
fix/resume-export-error

# Documentation branches
docs/update-contributing-guide

# Chore/maintenance branches
chore/dependency-updates
```

### 🔄 **Contribution Workflow**

git remote add upstream https://github.com/Muneerali199/DraftDeckAI.git

# Sync your fork before starting work
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

#### **Step 2: Create Feature Branch**

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
```

#### **Step 3: Commit Your Changes**

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle to navigation"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature
```

#### **Step 4: Create Pull Request**

2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the PR template
4. Link related issues
5. Submit for review!

### 📝 **Commit Message Format**

We use conventional commits for clarity:

```bash
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
feat: add new AI prompt optimization
fix: resolve mobile navigation issue
docs: update installation instructions
style: improve button hover animations
refactor: optimize database queries
test: add unit tests for resume generator
chore: update dependencies
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

Our coding standards ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the entire codebase.

### 🎯 **TypeScript Guidelines**

- **Always use TypeScript** - No plain JavaScript files
- **Strict typing** - Avoid `any` type whenever possible
- **Interface over Type** - Prefer interfaces for object shapes

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

// ❌ Avoid
const user: any = { ... }
```

### 🎨 **Styling Guidelines**

- **Tailwind CSS only** - No custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
- **Mobile-first approach** - Start with mobile styles, scale up
- **Consistent spacing** - Use Tailwind's spacing scale

```tsx
// ✅ Good
<button className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors">
  Click me
</button>

// ❌ Avoid inline styles
<button style={{ backgroundColor: '#007bff', padding: '8px 16px' }}>
  Click me
</button>
```

### 🧩 **Component Guidelines**

- **Use Radix UI** for complex components
- **Implement accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Props interfaces** for all components

```tsx
// ✅ Good component structure
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = "primary",
  children,
  onClick,
}) => {
  return (
    <button className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant }))} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### 🗂️ **Repository Hygiene**

> **⚠️ Do not commit backup, temporary, or stale artifacts to the repository.**

The repository should remain clean of non-canonical files. This helps reduce maintenance burden and ensures that new contributors aren't confused by stale artifacts.

Guidelines:
- **Avoid Route Backups**: Instead of keeping `page-old.tsx` or `layout.backup.tsx` in the `app/` directory, use Git's version history to retrieve older versions.
- **Clean Temp Files**: Avoid committing files with suffixes like `.bak`, `.tmp`, or `-restored`.
- **Active Source Only**: Ensure that only functional components and pages are tracked in the `app/` and `components/` directories.

```bash
# ❌ Avoid committing these patterns
*.bak
*.tmp
component.old.tsx
debug.log

# ✅ Only canonical source files
page.tsx
layout.tsx
component.tsx
```

If you need to preserve work-in-progress locally, use `git stash` or keep drafts in a personal branch — not in the active source tree.

### ✅ **Code Quality Checks**

Before submitting any PR, ensure:

```bash
# Linting passes
npm run lint

# TypeScript compilation succeeds
npm run build

# Tests pass (when implemented)
npm run test
```
