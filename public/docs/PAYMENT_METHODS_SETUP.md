## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For UPI (India):

1. **Business Verification Required**
   - Stripe requires Indian business registration
   - GST number (if turnover > ₹20 lakhs)
   - Bank account in India

2. **UPI Limitations**
   - Maximum amount: ₹1,00,000 per transaction
   - Minimum amount: ₹1
   - Real-time payments only (no recurring billing support yet)

3. **UPI for Subscriptions**
   - **Current Limitation**: UPI doesn't support automatic recurring billing
   - **Workaround**:
     - Use UPI for one-time payments only
     - For subscriptions, recommend cards or mandate-based payments
     - You can collect UPI for first payment, then card for recurring

### For All Payment Methods:

1. **Compliance**
   - Different payment methods have different compliance requirements
   - Ensure your business is registered in the regions you serve
   - Follow local tax and payment regulations

2. **Fees**
   - Each payment method has different processing fees
   - UPI: ~2% + currency conversion (if applicable)
   - Cards: 2.9% + $0.30
   - ACH: 0.8% (capped at $5)
   - Check Stripe's [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing)

3. **Settlement Times**
   - Cards: 2-7 business days
   - UPI: 1-3 business days
   - ACH: 5-7 business days

## 🔄 Alternative: Dynamic Payment Methods

If you want Stripe to automatically select the best payment methods, you can modify the code:

```typescript
// In lib/stripe.ts, replace payment_method_types with:
payment_method_types: undefined, // Let Stripe decide automatically

// Or use automatic payment methods:
automatic_payment_methods: {
  enabled: true,
  allow_redirects: 'always', // For UPI, PayPal, etc.
},
```

This will enable ALL payment methods available for the customer's location.

## 📊 Monitoring Payments

### Stripe Dashboard

1. **Payments** → View all transactions
2. **Filter by payment method** to see UPI vs Card usage
3. **Export reports** for accounting

### Webhook Events

The code already handles these webhook events:
- `checkout.session.completed` → Payment successful
- `customer.subscription.created` → New subscription
- `customer.subscription.updated` → Plan changed
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → Subscription cancelled
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` → Recurring payment successful
- `invoice.payment_failed` → Recurring payment failed

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Enable Relevant Methods Only**
   - Don't enable all methods if you don't operate in those regions
   - UPI only makes sense for Indian customers
   - Cash App only for US customers

2. **Customer Communication**
   - Update your pricing page to mention accepted payment methods
   - Add payment method icons for clarity
   - Explain region-specific options

3. **Fraud Prevention**
   - Enable Stripe Radar (fraud detection)
   - Set up 3D Secure for cards
   - Monitor unusual UPI patterns

4. **Optimize Checkout**
   - Show most popular method first
   - Use Stripe's automatic detection
   - Minimize form fields
